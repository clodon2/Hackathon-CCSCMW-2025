"""
For a target future semester (typically the next semester), generate a conflict report that:
Estimates how many students are planning to take each course.
Highlights course pairs that should not be scheduled at the same time.
Prioritizes conflicts to help in building the course schedule.

conflict level for each course pair based on:
üßµ Overlap: Number of students planning to take both courses that semester.
üîÅ Course Rarity: Less common courses (e.g., CS 356) have higher conflict weight than high-frequency ones (e.g., ENG 101).
üéì Student Seniority: A conflict is worse if many near-graduation students are affected.
üß† The system should be able to explain the reasoning behind any conflict level (e.g., ‚Äú6 students plan to take both; both are single-section upper-level courses; 4 are graduating seniors‚Äù).
