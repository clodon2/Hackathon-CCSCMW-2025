I had less time than I thought (and had to relearn some django stuff) so I'm finishing setup stuff rn, 
need a lot of front end and backend stuff
If you need a refresher or anything I am using this video (specifically I am at around this timestamp) https://youtu.be/Rp5vd34d-z4?si=YqaWBGr5TZJOhjPp&t=2596 . 
Probs need layouts as next big thing, but could do a bunch of stuff
