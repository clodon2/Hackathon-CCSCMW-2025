**_Hackathon Submission for CCSCMW 2025 (Virtual)_**

**Team Marietta College** <br>
**Authors:** Corey Verkouteren, Gabriella Davison


We built our solution in Django. To run, make sure you have python installed and 
create a virtual environment. After activating and accessing the environment run 
`pip install django` and `py manage.py runserver` once you have the project files in the environment.



**The Task** <br>
Build a system with two primary features:
1. Four-Year Student Plan Viewer & Editor
The system should display a student’s four-year academic plan.
The plan will include:
Past and current courses taken (imported from the registrar’s data).
Future planned courses, as entered by the student or advisor.
Semester-by-semester layout (Fall and Spring).
Future semesters should be editable, while past semesters are read-only.
This interface will be used in advising sessions to:
Check degree progress.
Update course selections.
Ensure the student is on track for graduation.
2. Scheduling Conflict Report Generator
For a target future semester (typically the next semester), generate a conflict report that:
Estimates how many students are planning to take each course.
Highlights course pairs that should not be scheduled at the same time.
Prioritizes conflicts to help in building the course schedule.


**Conflict Level Calculation** <br>
Your system should calculate a conflict level for each course pair based on:
🧵 Overlap: Number of students planning to take both courses that semester.
🔁 Course Rarity: Less common courses (e.g., CS 356) have higher conflict weight than high-frequency ones (e.g., ENG 101).
🎓 Student Seniority: A conflict is worse if many near-graduation students are affected.
🧠 The system should be able to explain the reasoning behind any conflict level (e.g., “6 students plan to take both; both are single-section upper-level courses; 4 are graduating seniors”).

**Inputs** <br>
Sample CSV data will be provided, including:
student.csv – student ID, name, email, expected graduation.
course.csv – course ID, department, number, title, credit hours.
section.csv – course offering identifiers and semesters.
enrollment.csv – past and current course enrollments.
planned.csv – future planned courses by semester.
offering.csv – list of courses offered per semester.
⚠ Note: The sample data may not include every edge case — your system must handle missing or unexpected situations gracefully.  The data may also be very inconsistent.  It was generated by AI for the sole purpose of showing the expected format of the data (not what different values of data exist)

**Outputs** <br>
✅ Student View Interface
Table or UI layout showing the four-year plan with the ability to edit future semesters.
Display of credits per semester and total.
✅ Conflict Report Table
A matrix showing conflict scores between courses in a given semester.
Each number reflects the conflict level, and the system must be able to explain it.

**Judging Criteria** <br>
✅ Functionality: Does it meet the two main goals?
✅ Conflict Accuracy: Is the conflict scoring meaningful and justified?
✅ Usability: Is the four-year plan interface intuitive?
✅ Code Quality: Is your system modular, readable, and maintainable?
✅ Innovation: Did you think through edge cases or offer additional useful features?

**Optional Enhancements (Bonus)**
🔍 Search or filter students/courses by criteria.
🕒 Predict scheduling bottlenecks multiple semesters ahead.
📊 Visualize student load or course popularity over time.
📱 Mobile-friendly version of the student view.
