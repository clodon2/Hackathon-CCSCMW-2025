I had less time than I thought (and had to relearn some django stuff) so I really only got through the basic setup. 
If you need a refresher or anything I am using this video (specifically I am at around this timestamp) https://youtu.be/Rp5vd34d-z4?si=YqaWBGr5TZJOhjPp&t=2596 . 
Probs need database setup as next big thing, but could also do frontend stuff first
